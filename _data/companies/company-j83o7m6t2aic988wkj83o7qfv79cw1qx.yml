about: "由西尔达维亚政府创建的的太空战略机构，在穆斯卡十二世签署《西尔达维亚国家太空战略法案》后成立，隶属于西尔达维亚宇航部门。其主要负责在战略层面上快速推进西尔达维亚在太空的发展，并协同其他科研机构共同发展本国宇航事业。在西尔达维亚太空军成立后，其失去了大部分存在的意义，转而成为一个半科研机构，并于2026年解散。\n\
  A space strategy agency which was created by the Syldavian government after King\
  \ Muskar XII signed the Syldavian National Space Strategy Act, affiliated to the\
  \ Syldavian Astronautical Administration. It is mainly responsible for the rapid\
  \ development of Syldavia in space at the strategic level, and in collaboration\
  \ with other scientific research institutions to develop our own space industry.\
  \ After the establishment of the Syldavian Astrokrachzy, it lost most of its meaning\
  \ and became a semi-scientific institution, which was disbanded in 2026."
