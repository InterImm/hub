DataHerb is built to make clean and documented small datasets easy to retrieve. DataHerb is a **metadata-driven** open data listing service for datasets.

> For Mac users, DataHerb is your "[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for small data".

## How Does It Work

DataHerb do **not** take your data. The datasets are fully managed by the owners or curators. Once a dataset is linked to DataHerb, we will aggregate the metadata and build a page for the dataset.

## How to Contribute

DataHerb is an initiative for transparent data management in open data. To achieve transparency, we use a metadata-driven design. Every step is transparent and can be investigated.

- Contribute datasets: list your datasets on DataHerb in just two steps. Datasets that can be used to enhance machine learning datasets are preferred. [Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/add)
- Write a short story to tell us about the story behind your dataset and submit to [DataHerb Articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles).
- Use DataHerb in your projects.
- Spread the words.
- Help us build a better DataHerb. [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/dataherb); [Leave a comment](#comments)

## Roadmap

- Python Package: load and explore any dataset together with the documentation using one line of python code.
- Command-line tool: create, load and explore any dataset together with the documentation in your terminal.
- Versioned datasets: make use of GitHub tag/release to version datasets and index versioned datasets automatically.
- Better APIs: [API for all datasets](/api/flora.json), ...
- **Your ideas**
